Erratum for "The Age of Everything"

In the acknowledgments, it should be the  Kavli Institute for 
Cosmological Physics.

In chapter 4, page 59, the sentence "Each time an 
atom of carbon-14 decays it emits an electron, which can be 
detected if it passes through a Geiger Counter." should actually say 
"...which can be detected if it passes through a device like a Geiger 
counter." While Libby and colleagues did use modified Geiger counters to 
detect the decay of carbon-14, these days gas proportional counters and 
liquid scintillation counters are often used instead.

In chapter 8 (also in the glossary and the index) the fossil mammal group
zalambdalestid is misspelled as zalambalestid.

In chapter 9, page 156, the statement that "the chondrule must have 
solidified a little over 1.5 million years after the CAI did" should be
"the chondrule must have solidified a little under 1.5 million years 
after the CAI did"

In Dr. Gribbin's review of the book for the Independent, he 
states that my "description of starbirth .... is just plain wrong". I 
believe that this criticism refers to a couple of paragraphs on pages 
172-173 of Chapter 10, where I attempt to explain how nuclear fusion can 
occur naturally in the centers of massive stars. In this context, I asked 
the reader to consider a simple thought experiment where a collection of 
hydrogen atoms collapse under their own gravity. I did not intend to 
imply here that this was a realistic model of star formation, instead I 
simply wanted to illustrate of how gravitational and nuclear forces can 
naturally reach a state of equilibrium. To make this clear, I probably 
should have included some statement like: "Note that real stars almost 
certainly were not formed in such a smooth and straightforward manner, 
but this simple picture demonstrates how the nuclear reactions in the 
core of star and the star's own gravity can balance each other."
