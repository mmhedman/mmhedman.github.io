The Age of Everything: How Science Explores the Past, by Matthew Hedman (Chicago, £14)
We are used to being told confidently of an enormous, measurable past: that some collection of dusty bones is tens of thousands of years old, or that astronomical bodies have an age of some billions. But how exactly do scientists come to know these things? That is the subject of this quite fascinating book, a collection of detective techniques that begins with the deciphering of Mayan hieroglyphs and the reconstruction of their extraordinary calendar, like a huge system of gears; and ends by tracing the universe back to its own birth.

As told by Hedman, an astronomer, each story is a marvel of compressed exegesis that takes into account some of the most modern and intriguing hypotheses. We learn, for example, that the tiny errors in compass alignment of the Egyptian pyramids might have been caused by changes in the Earth's angle of spin relative to the stars the architects used for reference, which if true would enable us to calculate their historical order definitively. We also learn much about improvements in carbon dating or evolutionary timelines, each of which comes with a swift introduction to quantum physics or genetics plus probability theory. The book is dense with fact but beautifully lucid, and the author occasionally allows himself a charming aside: "A rather big mess of math - which I must admit I have not worked through fully myself - is required to describe how energy can move through the universe." We'll take your word for it.
