Review in CHOICE

This book does not pretend to be a comprehensive survey of "humanity, earth, and the universe." Although not an expert in all covered areas, Hedman (Cornell Univ.) has produced a concise, readable, and instructive work that succeeds in explaining a sampling of methods for measuring age and modern applications of their use. Introduced by a section placing the book's coverage in historical context, the 12 chapters begin by exploring subjects in human history (i.e., methods used to determine exact dates in the life of a Mayan ruler) and progress to those in the most distant past (i.e., methods used to examine the age and composition of the universe). Carbon-14, potassium-argon, and even astronomical positioning are among the methods addressed. Each consistently structured chapter begins with a subject overview. This evolves into a discussion of age testing techniques used to study the subject, what has been learned via their application, and what scientists are continuing to explore. Additional reading lists conclude each chapter. Charts and illustrations are effectively used to support discussions. Prior knowledge of the subject matter is unnecessary, but some readers may need to consult the included glossary to understand some terminology.

Summing Up: Recommended. General readers; lower-division undergraduates through professionals.
