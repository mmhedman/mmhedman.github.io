Book Alert / The Age of Everything

The Age of Everything -- How Science Explores the Past by Matthew Hedman, UChicago Press '07, $25, 256 pages, ISBN #0-226-32292--0. Index, glossary, no bibliography, footnotes, b&w images sprinkled through text.

"Scientists today announced new evidence to show the solar system is 4.5 billion years old," intones the TV talking head. As those whose life span is a smidgen more than the biblical three-score-and-ten, we ask ourselves how could they ever make such a conclusion with authority? But scientists have their methods, and Matthew Hedman, a Cornell research associate, is here to give us an education.

Obviously, there's no one method to determine the age of things. Hedman happens to be an astronomer, so he uses one set, which includes guidelines I'll bet never occurred to you. For instance, the quality of static on your TV helps scientists calculate the age of the earth, solar system and universe.

Other methods help researchers determine when people arrived in the New World (answer: 15,000 years ago), when bipeds first appeared (4.5 million years ago), when Egyptians built the pyramids (4,500 years ago) and when the Big Bang occurred (14 billion years ago). Among the tools Hedman discusses are ancient Mayan calendars, carbon-dating, the use of potassium, argon and DNA; and molecular dating.
