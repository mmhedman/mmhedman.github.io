<b> Updates to "The Age of Everything" (by Chapter) </b>
<br>
<br>
<b> Chapter 1: Introduction </b>
<br>
<br>

<b> Chapter 2: The Calendars of the Classic Maya </b> 
<br> 
<br> 
<i> Added 2/1/09 </i> In the second (2008) edition of "Chronicles of the Mayan Kings and Queens" 
by S. Martin and N. Grube, the authors report on a revised interpretation of of one of the 
events involving Yuknoom Ch'een, B'alah Chan K'awiil and Nuun Ujol Chaak. Specifically, they now 
state that Nuun Ujol Chaak of Tikal did not arrive in Palenque in 659 after his defeat by 
Calakmul. This revision is based on work by D. Stuart referenced obliquely in a chapter by S. 
Martin in "Tikal: Dynasties, Foreigners and Affairs of State" (2003, edited by J.A. Sabloff), 
which asserts that the character named "Nuun Ujol Chaak" in the Palenque inscription is denoted 
as the ruler of a city called the "Wa-bird polity" (located in Santa Elena, not far from 
Palenque) instead of Mutual/Tikal. These authors therefore argue the king mentioned in the 
Palenque inscription is a different king who just happened to have the same name as the 
ill-fated king of Tikal.
<br> 
<br> 
While I must defer to the experts regarding the reading of what city the Nuun Ujol Chaak in the 
Palenque inscription was supposed to have ruled over, I am not entirely sure I accept the idea 
that there just happened to be two kings named "Nuun Ujol Chaak" ruling two different cities at 
the same time. As Martin points out in his chapter on Tikal, the date in the Palenque 
inscription is exactly 1 k'atun from B'alah Chan K'awiil's final defeat of Nuun Ujol Chaak 
9.12.6.16.17 (11 Kaban 10 Sotz, note this event was not included in the appendix to Chapter 2 
because the texts did not reference Yuknoom Ch'een directly). This seems to be a bit of a 
coincidence, and hints that the authors of either the Palenque or the Dos Pilas texts were 
trying to tie these two events together. This (along with the fact that Calakmul operating in 
nearby cities like Moral and Piedras Negras at this time) leads me to wonder if the Nuun Ujol 
Chaak of Santa Elena really was the same as the Nuun Ujol Chaak of Tikal. Perhaps Nuun Ujol 
Chaak chose Santa Elena as a base for operations when he could not rule in Tikal. Obviously, 
this is merely wild speculation on my part, and it is indeed possible that these coincidences in 
names and dates are just coincidences. Regardless, it would be very interesting to see if 
monuments from Santa Elena dating from this time period could shed light on this situation.

<b> Chapter 3: Precession, Polaris and the Age of the Pyramids </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 01/08/2010 </i> An interesting new paper entitled 
"Radiocarbon-Based Chronology for Dynastic Egypt" by 
C.B. Ramsey and colleagues has appeared in Science (Vol 328, Page 
1554-1557). This work performs a comprehensive analysis of many 
radiocarbon dates from throughout the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms
in order to better constrain the chronology of Ancient Egypt.
<br>
<br>
Of particular interest here is that these authors find that reigns of 
the various Old Kingdom rulers are about a century earlier than K. 
Spence's model would predict. If these findings are correct, then this 
would certainly invalidate Spence's method of dating the pyramids. 
However, this analysis included only a few radiocarbon dates from the 
Old Kingdom (several from the reign of Djoser, one from the reign of 
Snofru and one from a fifth Dynastry king Djedkare). The 
constraints on the age of the Old Kingdom are therefore not as 
robust as those for the Middle and New Kingdoms, and so some caution is 
needed when accepting these dates. Hopefully more radiocarbon dates 
from the Old Kingdom, and especially the fourth dynasty, will become 
available in the future.

<b> Chapter 4: The Physics of Carbon-14 </b>
<br>
<br>

<b> Chapter 5: Calibrating Carbon-14 Dates and the History of the Air </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 12/19/08 </i> A nice review article has appeared on 
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org">www.arxiv.org</a> that describes
how Carbon-14 and Beryllium-10 data can be used to infer changes
in solar activity over the last few thousand years, complete with 
numerous references. The article is "A History of Solar Activity
over Millennia" by I.G. Sokal <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0810.3872">

<br>

<b> Chapter 6: Carbon-14 and the Peopling of the New World </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 07/12/08 </i> Two papers in the 9 May 2008 issue of Science
(Volume 320) describe findings relevant to the earliest inhabitants in the 
New World. The first, by T.D. Dillehay and colleagues (pages 784-786)
is titled "Monte Verde: Seaweed, Food, Medicine , and the Peopling of 
South America" and it 
reports on samples of seaweed found at the Monte Verde site in 
south-central Chile. Carbon-14 
dates from this material are consistent with earlier evidence indicating 
that this site was occupied around 14,000 years ago. In other words, 
these new dates continue to support the idea that people inhabited this 
site well before the sites containing Clovis points appeared in North 
America. What is perhaps  more interesting, however, is the variety of 
different types of  seaweed found at this location, which provides 
information about resources used by the people who lived here. For 
example, some of the seaweed the excavators identify as coming from 
the Pacific Ocean.
<br>
<br>
The other paper, by Gilbert et al. (pages 786-790) and entitled "DNA from 
Pre-Clovis Human Coprolites in Oregon, North America" provides information
about a possibly new site where people may have lived before the 
appearance of Clovis points. This paper describes ancient 
feces from a cave in southern Oregon that contain human DNA. Carbon-14
dates of this material suggest that people were doing their business here 
sround 14,000 years ago. While ancient feces may not be the most glamorous 
thing to study, it does have the advantage that it is organic material
with a fairly direct connection with human activity. This greatly 
reduces the number of possible ways that the dates could provide
a misleading estimate of when people were in the area. Also, as
a new site, it holds the promise of providing a clearer picture 
of what people were doing before they created Clovis points. Even so, 
these new findings still need to be critically evaluated and the
relationships of this material to other remains in the area still
needs to be researched before the implications of these early dates
can be completely understood. (For the masochistic, some technical 
arguments about the finer points of this analysis appeared in the
10 July 2009 issue of Science, Vol 325, pg 148a-d.)
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 12/27/08 </i> Another interesting paper on the earliest 
inhabitants of the New World has been published in the journal American 
Antiquity (Vol 73(4) 2008, pp 670-698): "Archaeological roots of human 
diversity in the New World: A compilation of accurate and precise 
radiocarbon ages from earliest sites" by M.K. Faught. Like the works by 
Roosevelt et al. and Waters and Stafford referenced in the book, this 
paper describes a compilation of carbon-14 dates from the earliest known 
sites from the Americas. Comparing the best-dated sites from all over 
North and South America, this author demonstrates that there are a 
few sites found at widely separated locations around the New World 
before 11,000 years ago, followed by a much greater number of sites 
in several different regions after 
11,000 years ago. The author of this article points out that the 
rapid incrase in the number of sites occurs at nearly the same time in 
North and South America, which is difficult to reconcile with an wave of 
immigrants from the North. He suggests that instead of a wave of 
people moving through the ice-free corridor into the Americas at the end 
of the last ice age, the increase in the number of sites found after 
11,000 years ago may reflect the dispersal of people away from the 
coasts prompted by changes in sea levels associated with the end of the 
Ice Age. This would imply that both the east and 
west coasts of North America and the western coast of South America were 
already inhabited before 11,000 years ago. Of course, the details of 
that early occupation is still unclear.
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 4/29/11: </i> A very interesting paper has recently been 
published on pages 1599-1603 in Volume 331 of the Journal <i>Science</i> 
(2011). This paper, entitled "The Buttermilk Creek Complex and the 
Origins of Clovis at the Debra L. Friedkin Site, Texas" by M.R. Waters 
and collaborators, describes a site that provides some of the best 
evidence yet for a pre-Clovis occupation in North America. This site
preserves a very clear sequence of lithic artifacts in a series of 
strata dating back a couple of thousand years before the Clovis era. 
These strata are nicely layered and have been dated, not by radiocarbon 
methods, but instead by optically-stimulated luminesence methods. These 
dates form a coherent sequence and thus seem robust, but what makes the 
site particularly interesting is that it preserves multiple stone tools 
that seem to redate to distinctive Clovis artifacts. This site thus 
provides an opportunity to better understand what artifacts might 
be used to identify other potential pre-Clovis occupations.
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 01/07/12 </i> Another bit of information about pre-Clovis 
people in North America has been published in the paper "Pre-Clovis 
Mastodon Hunting 13,800 Years Age at the Manis Site, Washington" by 
M.R. Waters et al. (Science, 334, 351-353, 2011). This paper describes 
a stone point lodged in a Mastadon bone that dates back about 1000 
years before people started making Clovis points. 
<br>
<br>


<b> Chapter 7: Potassium, Argon, DNA and Walking Upright </b> <br> <br>

<i> Added 03/29/08: </i> A couple of interesting papers on early ancestors
of humans have appeared recently. First, on page 1662-1664 of volume 319
of <i>Science</i> there is an article "<i>Orrorin tugenensis</i> Femoral
Morphology and the Evolution of Hominin Bipedalism" by W.F. Richmond and
W.L.Jungers. This paper analyzes a 6-million-year-old femur (leg bone)  
belonging to an early hominid named <i>Orrorin tugenensis</i> and compares
measurements of this bone with those of humans, hominids and other great
apes. This analysis indicates that<i> Orrorin</i> was bipedal, which if
correct would imply our ancestors first began to walk upright at least 6
million years ago. <br> <br> Another interesting paper by A.-E. Lebatard
and colleagues entitled "Cosmogenic nuclide dating of <i>Sahelanthropus
tchadensis</i> and <i>Australopithecus bahrelghazali</i>: Mio-Pliocene
hominids from Chad" has appeared in <it>The Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science</i> (Volume 105, pages 3226-3231). This article
describes efforts to date the early hominid fossils found in Chad. As
mentioned in the book, these fossils cannot be dated directly with
Potassium-Argon techniques because this region does not contain the right
sorts of volcanic deposits.  The authors of this paper therefore turned to
another unstable nuclei, Beryllium-10, which is created in the atmosphere
by cosmic rays much like Carbon-14. Unlike Carbon-14 atoms, however,
Beryllium-10 atoms do not remain in the atmosphere as part of gas
molecules, but instead fall to earth in rain and collect in lakes, etc.
The sedimentary deposits laid down in the bottom of lakes therefore
contain some Beryllium-10 when they form, which then steadily decays away
with a half-life of about 1.4 million years. As with any other method of
measuring age with unstable nuclei, the trick is to estimate how much
Beryllium-10 these deposits contained originally, which is especially
challenging because the total Beryllium content of a lake includes
material extracted from local rocks, so the original Beryllium-10 content
of a deposit (relative to other isotopes of Beryllium) can vary from place
to place. The authors of this study deal with this issue by comparing the
Beryllium-10 content of the fossil-bearing deposits with those from the
same region, which is a large basin centered on Lake Chad.

<br>
<br>

The authors find that the ages they estimate for various deposits in this 
region match those derived based on the types of fossil animals found in 
the different layers of rock. In particular, they find that the deposits 
containing the early hominid <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i> are about 7 
million years old, confirming the previous dates based on the presence of 
certain fossil animals. These new dates therefore can provide some 
additional support to the great age of these fossils, and their importance 
in understanding the origins of bipedalism. 

<br>
<br>

<i> Added 10/16/09 </i> An extremely important series of papers 
have appeared in the 10/02/09 issue of Science (available 
<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/"> here</a>).
These papers describe in detail a fossil hominid <i>Ardipithecus
ramidus</i> found in Ethiopian deposits dating back to about 4.4 million 
years ago. The age of the fossils is well established by virtue of being 
sandwiched between two volcanic deposits that can be dated with the 
Potassium-Argon system. These fossils are not as old as the
<i>Sahelanthropus</i> and <i>Orrorin</i> finds, but they are 
nevertheless signficant because they include many bones of
a single individual, including parts of the hands, feet and pelvis. 
This is therefore the oldest fossil hominid specimen that is complete 
enough to provide a reasonable picture of how it moved around, and 
therefore can potentially shed important new light on the origin of 
our peculiar form of bipedalism.

<br>
<br>

While <i>Ardipithecus</i> has some characteristics in its pelvis and 
feet which indicate that it could walk on two legs, it does not
appear to have all the characters of later hominids that make them 
efficient bipedal walkers. Furthermore, some characteristics of 
<i>Ardipithecus</i>,  such as a big toe that is out of alignment 
with the rest of the foot, indicate that it retained adaptations for 
clambering through trees. Also of interest is the fact that the hands 
and feet of <i>Ardipithecus</i> do not show adaptations for vertical 
climbing or knuckle-walking found in modern chimpanzees. This suggests
that the ancestors of chimpanzees acquired these traits sometime 
after they split off from the ancestors of modern humans, while
our ancestors retain a more generalized anatomy suitable for clambering
on branches until they developed the ability to walk upright.
These findings certainly cast important new light on the origin
of bipedalism.

<br>
<br>

Of special relevance to the discussion in the book is a comment made 
by White et al. on page 81. Here the authors call into question the 
estimated age of the split between the ancestors of modern Chimpanzees 
and the ancestors of modern Humans. They argue that many 
characters shared by gorillas and chimpanzees (such as knuckle walking)
are not found in <i>Ardipithecus</i>, so these animals probably
differ more from the last common ancestor of chimpanzees, gorillas
and humans than was previously appreciated. They then suggest that this 
could mean that more time might be neccesary from the different groups
to acquire their unique characters. While I agree with the first point,
I think the second is rather questionable. If there was clear evidence
for knuckle-walking chimpanzee-ancestors from 6 million years ago, then
there might be reason to question the age estimates derived from 
molecualr analyses, but at present the fossil record of the ancestors of 
chimpanzees and gorillas is so sparse that I cannot see any way to make 
any sensible argument about how long it should have taken the ancestors 
of chimpanzees or gorillas to acquire their unique traits. It seems to 
me that the <i>Ardipithecus</i> findings simply emphasize that we need 
information about both our unique ancestors and the ancestors of our 
nearest relatives, the chimpanzees and gorillas to clarify the history
of bipedalism. Only by comparing the trends and traits
among these different lineages will we be able to fully understand the 
particular circumstances that led to our unique mode of locomotion.

<br>
<br>
<i> Added 8/18/12:</i> An interesting analysis of divergence times 
between the ancestors of humans and great apes has recently appeared in 
the Proceedings of National Academy of Science. K.E. Langegraber and 
coleagues' article "Generation times in wild chimpanzees and 
gorilla suggest earlier diverge times in great ape and human evolution" 
describes an effort to compute divergence times independent of any 
fossil information. In essence, they use the number of mutations found 
between generations in humans and new estimates of generation times in 
great apes to estimate how much time would be needed for chimps and 
humans to have the number of genetic differences observed today.  
These calculations inidcate that humans and chimpanzees last shared a 
common ancestor between 7 and 13 million years ago. These are quite a 
bit older than the 4-6 million year estimates of previous studies, and 
might have implications for the interpretation of some of the early 
hominid fossils like <i> Orrorrin, Ardipithecus </i> and <i> 
Sahelanthropus </i>/
<br>
<br>

<b> Chapter 8: Molecular Dating and the Many Types of Modern Mammals </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 11/03/07:</i> There have been a number of interesting papers 
published recently using new gene sequence data to examine and refine the 
relationships between the different orders of placental mammals. These 
papers, instead of looking at the point substitution mutations discussed 
in the book, focus on insertions and deletions of short stretches of DNA. 
These sorts of mutations are relatively rare and are less likely to occur 
multiple times, so they can potentially help resolve some of the 
relationships among mammalian orders.
<br>
<br>

Two recent analyses suggest slight re-arrangements of the relationships 
shown in Figure 8.3 of the book. One study finds that within 
Laurasiatheria, the 
animals in the orders Carnivora (and presumably Pholidota), Chiroptera and 
Perrisodactyla are more closely related to each other than any of them is 
to animals in the orders Cetacea or Artiodactlya (see "Pegasoferae, an 
unexpected mammalian clade revealed by tracking ancient retroposon 
insertions" by Nisihara et al. in <i> Proceedings and of the National 
Academy of Sciences </i> Volume 103 (2006), pages 9929-9934.) Another 
analysis
finds that Dermopterans or Flying Lemurs are more closely related to 
Primates than to Scandentians or Tree Shrews (see "Molecular and Genomic 
Data Identify the Closest Living relative of Primates" by Janecka et al. 
in <i> Science </i> Volume 792 (2007), page 792-794.)
<br>
<br>

At a more fundamental level, another recent paper provides genetic data 
suggesting that Xenarthrans may be more closely related to Afrotherians 
than to Euarchontoglires or Laurasiatherians (see "Using genomic data to 
unravel the root of placental mammal phylogeny" by Murphy et al. in 
<i> Genome Research </i> Volume 17 (2007) pages 413-421. If correct, these 
findings could bring the the picture of mammal migrations inferred from 
the genetic data more in line with the fossil evidence. If Xenarthrans and 
Afrotherians are more closely related to each other than either one is to 
Euarchontoglires or Laurasiatherians, this might mean that one group 
of early eutherians from the northern continents moved into the southern 
hemisphere to become the ancestors of Afrotherians and Xenarthrans, while 
another group remained in the northern hemisphere and formed the ancestors 
of Euarchonotoglires and Laurasiatherians. 
<br>
<br>

One challenge presented by these new findings is that because the 
insertion or deletion of DNA sequences is comparatively rare, only a 
small number of these mutations identify any given group. These mutations 
therefore cannot themselves provide estimates of when these 
various groups diverged. Age estimates therefore 
still must be derived from the point substitution mutation data. Since 
analyses of these data favor somewhat different groupings of the 
orders, there are clearly some issues with the reliability of such dates. 
Future research should help clarify this situation and help resolve 
whether any of these seeming inconsistencies are merely due to the limited 
number of organisms studied thus far.
<br>
<br>

<b> Chapter 9: Meteorites and the Age of the Solar System </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 09/06/09 </i> A recent paper has come out
that lends further support to the idea that the short-lived
radioactive nuclei like Aluminum-26 was distrubted uniformly in
the early Solar System and thus can be used to date events from
that time. The paper is called "Homogeneous Distribution of 
26Al in the Solar System from the Mg Isotopic Composition of Chondrules"
by J. Villeneuve, M. Chaussidon and G. Libourel in Science Volume 325, 
pg 985-988. In it, the authors, provide evidence that objects which
formed with a lower fraction of Aluminum-26 also initially had a
higher initial concentration of Magnesium-26. This is what one would
expect if Aluminum-26 was introduced into the Solar System in a
single burst, and as time went on, that Aluminum-26 steadily decayed 
away to produce more and more Magnesium-26. The authors also provide
new evidence that the Chondrules in a particular Chondritic meteorite 
solidified over a time-span of a couple of million years.
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 05/20/10 </i> A paper has now appeared in the journal
Science ("238U/235U Variations in Meteorites: Extant 247Cm and 
Implications for Pb-Pb Dating" by Brennecka et al. Volume 327, pages 
449-451 (2010))that reveals some new complications
for efforts to accurately date meteoritic material using the
decay of various isotopes of Uranium into Lead. Normally, this
technique assumes that all materials have the same ratio of
Uranium isotopes. However, these researchers have found that the
ratio of Uranium-238 to Uranium-235 can in fact vary by 0.3% in
various parts of certain meteorites.
Much of these variations in the Uranium isotope ratio seem to be
correlated with the abundance of elements like Thorium and Neodymium.
Just as the correlation between the variations in Magnesium isotope 
ratios and the amount of Aluminum in different parts of meteorites
imply that the meteorite originally contained some short-lived isotopes 
like Aluminum-26 that decayed long ago. In this case 
the most likely explanation for these variations is that
the meteorites that now contain more Thorium and Neodynium also  
contained more short-lived isotopes of Curium, which has similar
chemical properties. This Curium then decayed to produce excess
Uranium-235. This excess Uranium-235 can affect the dates derived
from Uranium-Lead by a few million years. Given these rocks are 4.5 
billion years old, this is not a big affect, but it is important
in efforts to measure small differences in ages between CAIs,
chondrules and other components of meteorites.
<br>
<br>
<b> Chapter 10: Colors, Brightness and the Age of Stars </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 07/12/08 </i> I recently became aware of another paper
that discusses the implications of the new measurements of nuclear
reactionrates on the age of globular clusters. This article is by 
Degl'Innocenti et al. and is published in Physics Letters B 590 (2004) 
13-20.
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 01/10/08 </i> A brief review article has appeared in Science 
that cites various methods for measuring the age of stars (and provides 
some useful references). It is "How Old Is That Star?" By D.R. Soderblom 
in Science, Vol 323 (2009) pg 45-46.
<br>
<br>

<b> Chapter 11: Distances, Redshifts and the Age of the Universe </b>
<br>
<br>
<i> Added 03/29/08 </i> New measurements of 60 Type Ia Supernovae and 
their implications for the composition of the universe are described in 
three papers in volume 666 of the <i> The Astrophysical Journal </i>, 
pages 674-725 by Miknaitis et al., Wood-Vasey et al. and Davis et al.
These additional continue to support the idea that the present-day 
universe on average contains about three parts Dark Energy for every one 
part matter, and that the Dark Energy can be treated as a cosmological 
constant.
<br>
<br>
<br><i> Added 05/20/10</i> A good review of efforts to measure
the Hubble constant by W.L. Freedman and B.F. Madore (Annual
Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol 48, arXiv:1004.1856).
These measurements provide information about the distances
to various galaxies  which are essential to determine the
expansion history of the universe.
<br>
<br>

<b> Chapter 12: Parameterizing the Age of the Universe </b>
<br>
<br><i> Added 03/09/08:</i> New data on the brightness variations in 
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) have recently appeared on-line. 
High-resolution measurements from an earth-based instrument known as ACBAR 
can now be found <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1491> here <a>, and a 
series of papers describing the latest results from the WMAP spacecraft 
can be found <a href=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current> here 
<a>. The WMAP papers include refined measurements of many cosmological 
parameters, including the curvature and the age of the universe, as well 
as comparisons with other astronomical measurements. All these 
data still indicate that the universe is close to flat, and if flat is 
about 13.7 billion years old.

<br>
<br>

It is interesting to note that in some of these recent papers the 
authors  state that the CMB data alone cannot provide tight constraints on 
the curvature of the universe (see the paper by Komatsu et al., for 
example). By contrast, I describe in Chapter 12 how the patterns in the 
CMB can provide us with a pretty good measure of the curvature and the 
total energy density in the universe. This is not so much a contradiction 
as much as a measure of how far cosmology has come over the last few years 
in determining the structure and composition of the universe. As I 
discussed in the book, the apparent size of structures in the CMB is most 
sensitive to the overall curvature of the universe. However, it is also 
true that these measurements can also be affected somewhat by the 
composition of the universe (which can change the expansion history). This 
places limits on how precisely cosmologists can measure the curvature with 
CMB data alone. With the increasing precision of 
the various data sets, cosmologists are not satisfied with these limits
and so are using data from other observations (like supernovae) to  
constrain the composition and structure of the universe and refine their 
estimates of parameters like the curvature or age of the universe.
