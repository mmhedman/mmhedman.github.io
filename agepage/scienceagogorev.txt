We all get pretty obsessive when it comes down to knowing the "age" of stuff, except when it gets personal, in which case the old adage "you're only as young as you feel" holds. Our age obsession shouldn't come as a big surprise, considering all of the birthdays and date-laden history lessons we've had to endure over the years. But while records can show how old we are, how old our respective nations are, or even how long an ancient civilization reigned for, how do scientists determine the age of anything before recorded history? In The Age Of Everything, Matthew Hedman, a research associate in the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University, shows exactly how scientists go about the process of aging anything from Mayan civilizations, to the age of the universe itself. In clear and enlightening prose, Hedman explains how some of the world's greatest mysteries are succumbing to advanced dating techniques. The Great Pyramids typify this kind of mystery, exciting the imagination of both scientist and layman alike. But now, we are told, the pyramids can be read like a tome, with their exact age and building method finally revealed. We all know that the rings of a tree can tell us their age, but trees can also tell scientists how the surface of the sun has changed over the previous ten millennia. On an even grander scale, Hedman explains how scientists, using the ancient light from stars, and, surprisingly, the static from your TV, can reveal the origins of the Earth and the Solar System.
