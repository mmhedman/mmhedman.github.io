Astronomer Matthew Hedman compiled his public lectures explaining recent 
advances in the physical sciences into a fascinating book. Using a 
multidisciplinary approach, he broaches the field of dating evidence 
from the pastâ€”the text covers the big bang through the evolution of 
numerous and varied civilizations. Using a wide range of time scales, 
the author examines specific points in time and describes and explains 
the dating methods. Chapters cover the Mayan calendar, Egyptian 
pyramids, carbon-14 dating with its standardization, potassium and argon 
tracings, current molecular dating, evidence from meteorites, the age of 
the stars, and the age of the universe.

Science attracts problem solvers, and Hedman provides a good model for 
such thinking. Included here are myriad chronological mysteries that 
have become more understandable as techniques have been devised to 
enable us to expand our understanding of past history. This is a science 
detective story in which clues regarding the past are revealed through 
circuitous means. Readers see how hypotheses are generated for further 
testing and expansion of data. The text is skillfully reinforced with 
clarifying tables and explanatory diagrams. This would be an enriching 
supplement for secondary and college multidisciplinary science programs 
because of its emphasis on the methods of science.
