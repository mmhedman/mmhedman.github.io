<h4> Background, Updates, Errata and Miscellany </h4>

Here is a copy of the
slides and lecture notes for the <a href="compton/compton1.html">2004 
Compton Lectures</a> that formed the basis for the book. I
warn any reader that this stuff is pretty raw and it contains some glitches 
that got ironed out in the book. I also apologize for the really cruddy 
HTML formatting of the slides.
<br>
<br>
I started each of the lectures with a little cartoon to remind myself and 
my audience that I am not an authority on many of the subjects I 
discussed. I made similar cartoons to introduce each chapter of the book, 
but the consensus was that they were a little too cute and so they were 
dropped from the published book. For the curious, copies of those cartoons 
can be found <a href=cartoons/cartoons.html>here</a>.
<br>
<br> 
As I state in the introduction to the book, the subjects I cover are 
areas of active research, so I will post updates <a 
href="agebookupdates.html">here</a> on new findings 
that are relevant to the discussions in the book.
<br>
<br>
Finally, for the nit-pickers out there, here is an <a 
href="agebookerror.html">Erratum</a> for the book. Most of the 
typos listed here were fixed in the paperback version of the book.
