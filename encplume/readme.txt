The data is these ascii tables are those shown in Figures 7-9 of
the paper "Spectral Observations of the Enceladus Plume with 
Cassini-VIMS" by Hedman et al. (ApJ 693:1749-1762, 2009). The 
files named "plumespecval" give the mean values and the ones marked 
"plumespecerr" give the error bars. The files are marked "Group1", 
"Group2" and "Group3" consistent with the paper's notation.

In the tables themselves, the rows correspond to wavelengths and 
columns correspond to altitudes as marked. Note the lowest altitudes 
(not included in the plots) are on Enceladus' disk and therefore do not 
provide useful plume data.
