<h3> Sumerian Noun Phrases </h3>

<p> Sumerian nouns are divided into two groups: <i> animate </i> and <i> inanimate</i>.<br>
Animate nouns are people and gods, and inanimate nouns are everything else (objects, animals, etc.) </p>

<p> Sumerian does not mark gender, so there are no separate pronouns for "he" and "she". </p>

<p> The noun can be followed by adjectives. <br> 
lugal means  "king" but  lugal.gal means " a great king" </p>

<p> Possessive pronouns can be attached to either a noun or a noun+adjective complex <br>
lugal.ani means "his king" and lugal.gal.ani means "his great king" </p>

<table>
<caption> <h4> Sumerian Possessive suffixes</caption>
<tr><td> -gu<sub>10</sub> </td><td> my </td><td> lugal.gu<sub>10</sub> </td><td>"my king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -zu</td><td>  your (singular) </td><td> lugal.zu </td><td>"your king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -ani</td><td> his/her (animate) </td><td> lugal.ani</td><td> "his/her king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -bi</td><td> its (inaminate)</td><td> lugal.bi </td><td>"its king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -me</td><td> our</td><td> lugal.me </td><td>"our king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -zu.ne(.ne) </td><td> your  (plural) </td><td> lugal.zu.ne </td><td>"your (plural) king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -a.ne.ne </td><td> their (animate) </td><td> lugal.a.ne.ne </td><td>"their king" </td></tr>
<tr><td> -bi</td><td>their (inanimate) </td><td> lugal.bi </td><td>"their king" </td></tr>
</table>

<p> Animate nouns are made plural by adding the suffix .ene, which comes after any adjectives
of possessive suffixes <br>
lugal.ene would be "kings", lugal.gal.ene is "great kings"  <p> 

<p> Both types of nouns can also be made plural by reduplicating the word, which may also give a sense of totality <br> lugal.lugal would then mean "all the kings" and gud,gud would mean "all the oxen". </p>


<p> After the noun, adjectives, possessive pronouns, and plural marker comes the case ending,
which indicates what function the modified noun plays in the sentence. Annoyingly, some of these can often disappear in the texts. </p>
